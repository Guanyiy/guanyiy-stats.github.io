## Statistical Methods & Areas of Expertise

### **Regression & Classification**
- Linear, logistic, multinomial, and ordinal (PO, PPO, adjacent-category) models  
- Class imbalance handling, transformations, and sensitivity analyses  
- Predictive performance evaluation using RMSE, log-likelihood, and cross-validation  

### **High-Dimensional Inference**
- PCA and **Sparse PCA (NExOS algorithm)**  
- K-means and hierarchical clustering  
- Feature selection for large-scale time-series and behavioral data  
- Applications to Digital Cages actigraphy data (millions of observations)

### **Semiparametric & Nonparametric Methods**
- Generalized additive models (GAMs) using smoothing splines  
- Shape-constrained estimation and interpretability-preserving structures  
- Kernel-based diagnostics and graph-based goodness-of-fit  

### **Bayesian Modeling**
- Hierarchical models in Stan  
- Prior formulation, adaptive sampling, and parallel chains  
- Posterior predictive checks, LOO-CV, and DIC  

### **Causal Inference**
- Propensity score estimation (WeightIt)  
- Overlap diagnostics & weight truncation  
- Doubly robust AIPW and TMLE estimation  
- Partial-overlap regime identification and trimming rules  

### **Latent Variable Models**
- Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for cognitive domains  
- Measurement invariance across education groups  
- Structural modeling of adapted assessment batteries  

### **Missing Data & Robust Estimation**
- Structural missingness patterns in cognitive datasets  
- MNAR considerations and sensitivity analyses  
- Recoding, screening, and pipeline-based reproducibility  

### **Statistical Computing**
- Simulation of SDEs, GBM, and stochastic processes  
- High-performance computation for PCA & MCMC  
- Reproducible workflows in R Markdown and Python
