## Statistical Methods & Interests

### Semiparametric and Nonparametric Inference  
Shape-constrained smoothing, estimating equations, and methods preserving interpretability under flexible link functions.

### Diagnostics and Goodness-of-Fit  
Graph-based diagnostics, model misspecification detection, overlap assessment, sensitivity analysis.

### High-Dimensional Methods  
Sparse PCA, NExOS algorithm implementation, clustering, regularization, and dimension reduction pipelines.

### Missing Data and Robust Estimation  
Pattern diagnostics, MNAR considerations, and modeling under structural missingness.

### Statistical Computing  
Simulation, optimization, and reproducible workflow development in R/Python.
