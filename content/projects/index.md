## Selected Projects

### Sparse PCA using NExOS  
Implementation of the NExOS algorithm for sparse PCA on synthetic and real high-dimensional handwriting datasets.  
Includes tuning procedures, selection stability, and recovery diagnostics.

### GLM & Count Models  
Poisson, quasi-Poisson, and Negative Binomial comparisons on bike sharing demand.  
Includes diagnostics for dispersion, time-series structure, and interpretability.

### Clustering & PCA (USArrests)  
Hierarchical clustering, k-means, and principal component analysis with visualization and interpretation.

### SVM & Kernel Methods  
Margin classifier formulation, support vector identification, and kernel trick implementation.

### High-Dimensional Behavioral Modeling  
Missingness, zero inflation, and dimension reduction pipelines for complex behavioral datasets.
