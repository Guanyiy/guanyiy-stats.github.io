## Selected Statistical Projects

### **Multinomial Classification of Cognitive Impairment (HRS-HCAP & Mex-Cog)**
- Fit and compared multinomial logistic models and ordinal frameworks (PO, PPO, AC).  
- Addressed challenges including skewed covariates, missingness, and class imbalance.  
- Produced a reproducible 20+ page R Markdown pipeline.  

### **Sparse PCA & High-Dimensional Behavioral State Modeling (Digital Cages)**
- Applied PCA, Sparse PCA (NExOS), k-means, and hierarchical clustering to millions of observations.  
- Developed pipelines for dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, and temporal alignment.  

### **Causal Effect of Oral Health on Hearing (NHANES 2021–2023)**
- Estimated treatment effects using AIPW and TMLE.  
- Assessed overlap, truncated weights, and performed sensitivity to PS restriction.  
- Produced interpretable effect sizes with reproducible scripts.  

### **Modeling Temporal Effects in Bike-Share Demand (DC 2011–2012)**
- Compared Poisson, quasi-Poisson, Negative Binomial, GAMs, and mixed models.  
- Evaluated dispersion, zero inflation, cross-validated RMSE, and residual diagnostics.  

### **Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling of Work Hour Trends**
- Fit hierarchical models in Stan with sector-specific random effects.  
- Optimized MCMC performance and performed LOO-CV, posterior predictive checks.  

### **Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Adapted Assessment Validity (Nepal HCAP)**
- Tested memory-domain measurement models using WLSMV in Mplus.  
- Compared adapted items with standard forms across education strata.  
- Demonstrated improved validity and reduced floor effects.

### **Stochastic Simulation for European Option Pricing**
- Implemented Euler–Maruyama schemes and Delta/Gamma-neutral hedging.  
- Conducted 100,000+ simulations under GBM assumptions with optimized runtime.
