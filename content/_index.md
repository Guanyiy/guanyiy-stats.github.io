title: "Statistical Modeling & Robust Inference"
---

Hi, I'm **Guanyi Yang**, a master's student in Applied Statistics at the University of Michigan.

My work focuses on **statistical modeling, semiparametric inference, diagnostics, and high-dimensional data analysis**, with applications to cognitive aging, global health, and behavioral science. I develop reproducible pipelines in R and Python for simulation, estimation, and validation of statistical methods in complex empirical settings.

### **Research Interests**
- Statistical modeling for complex population data  
- Semiparametric & nonparametric methods  
- High-dimensional inference (Sparse PCA, clustering, dimension reduction)  
- Multinomial & ordinal regression modeling  
- Missing data mechanisms; sensitivity analyses  
- Diagnostics, goodness-of-fit, overlap assessment  
- Bayesian modeling & hierarchical structures  

### **Current Work**
I am currently involved in:
- **Multinomial logistic modeling** for cognitive impairment classification (HRS-HCAP, Mex-Cog)  
- **Measurement modeling & factor analysis** for adapted assessments in Nepal HCAP  
- **Sparse PCA and clustering** for high-dimensional actigraphy data  
- **Causal inference & TMLE** in NHANES oral–hearing health analyses  
- **Time-series modeling & GAMs** for spatiotemporal patterns in DC bike-sharing counts  

This website highlights my methods work, statistical projects, and reproducible modeling pipelines.
