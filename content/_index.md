title: "Statistical Modeling & Robust Inference"
---

### Hi, I’m Guanyi.

I work at the intersection of **statistical modeling, semiparametric inference, diagnostics, and high-dimensional behavioral data**.  
My research interests include:

- Semiparametric & nonparametric methods  
- Model diagnostics & goodness-of-fit  
- High-dimensional inference (Sparse PCA, clustering)  
- Missing data mechanisms & robust estimation  
- Statistical modeling for complex population data  

I build reproducible R/Python pipelines for simulation, resampling, and empirical validation of statistical methods.

This website showcases my statistics-focused projects, methods work, and research portfolio.
